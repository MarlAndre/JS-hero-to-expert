# JS-hero-to-expert
I'm following The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! offered by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

I will be pushing some of the project to GitHub and deploy them on Netlify, the link to the app can be find in their respective folder with more details about the project. 

My core focus at the moment is to have a better understanding of JavaScript and to learn React and Vue, I found this course very useful as it helps me understand more the concepts I've been using during the coding bootcamp at Le Wagon.
